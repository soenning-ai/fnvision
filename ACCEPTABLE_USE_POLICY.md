# Acceptable Use Policy

fnvision is open-source software released under the Apache License 2.0.

This Acceptable Use Policy is a personal statement by the author and reflects the values and intent behind this project. It is not a legal amendment to the license, but a clear expression of purpose.

## Purpose

fnvision was built to advance research in perception, vision systems, and efficient visual processing. It was made with curiosity, care, and the belief that good technology should serve people, not harm them.

## Unacceptable Uses

The author explicitly opposes the use of fnvision, in whole or in part, for:

- Weapons systems, including autonomous or semi-autonomous targeting, kill chains, or any system designed to injure or kill human beings
- Surveillance of individuals, including tracking, profiling, identifying, or monitoring people without their informed and freely given consent
- Mass surveillance, including large-scale monitoring of populations by governments, corporations, or other entities
- Suppression of human rights, including applications designed to restrict freedom of expression, movement, assembly, or access to information
- Deception and manipulation, including systems designed to deceive individuals or manipulate public perception through synthetic or altered visual content

## A Personal Note

This project is released to support open collaboration in research and engineering.

That trust comes with responsibility.

If you use this code, consider not only what you can build, but what it will be used for and who it might affect. Technology is not neutral - the choices we make as builders shape the world others live in.

This policy is not enforceable through the Apache-2.0 license text. It is a clear statement of intent: this code was not made to harm people.
